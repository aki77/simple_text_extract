# ðŸ“„ SimpleTextExtract

SimpleTextExtract attempts extract text from various file types and is recommended as a guard before resorting to something more extreme like Apache Tika. It is built specifically with ActiveStorage in mind and originally built for the purpose of extracting text from attachments in order to index the text in ElasticSearch using [SearchKick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick).

SimpleTextExtract handles parsing text from:

- `.pdf`
- `.docx`
- `.doc`
- `.xlsx`
- `.xls`
- `.txt` ðŸ˜œ

If no text is parsed (for `pdf`), or a file format is not supported (like images), then `nil` is returned and you can move on to the heavy-duty tools like [Henkei](https://github.com/abrom/henkei) ðŸ’ª.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "simple_text_extract"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_text_extract

## Usage

Text can be parsed from raw file content or files in the filesystem t by calling `SimpleTextExtract.extract`:

```ruby
# raw file content using ActiveStorage
SimpleTextExtract.extract(filename: attachment.blob.filename, raw: attachment.download)

# filesystem
SimpleTextExtract.extract(filepath: "path_to_file.pdf")
```

### Usage Dependencies

You can choose to use SimpleTextExtract without the following dependencies, but it won't work for specific file types:

`pdf` parsing requires `poppler-utils`
- `brew install poppler`

`doc` parsing requires `antiword`
- `brew install antiword`

### Usage on Heroku

To use on Heroku you'll have to add some custom buildpacks.


##### heroku-buildpack-activestorage-preview

If you're using ActiveStorage, you might already have the [heroku-buildpack-activestorage-preview](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-activestorage-preview) added, which means you already have `poppler-utils` installed ðŸŽ‰

If not, you can either add that buildpack, or add `poppler-utils` to your `Aptfile` (see below).

##### heroku-buildpack-apt

To add `antiword` as a dependency on Heroku, install the [heroku-buildpack-apt](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt) buildpack and follow the install instructions.

In your `Aptfile`, add:
```
antiword
```

## Benchmarks

*Benchmarks test extracting text from the same file 50 times (Macbook pro)*

| File format | SimpleTextExtract | Henkei (i.e. Yomu/Apache Tika) |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| .doc        | 1.40s             | 74.27s                         |
| .docx       | 0.78s             | 71.44s                         |
| .pdf*       | 1.73s             | 82.86s                         |
| .xlsx       | 21.99s            | 51.89s                         |
| .txt        | 0.036s            | 39.25s                         |

* SimpleTextExtract is limited in its text extraction from pdfs, as Tika can also perform OCR on pdfs with Tesseract

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
